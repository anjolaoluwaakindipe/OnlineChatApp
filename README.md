# ONLINE CHAT APP
This is a mini project so I can try and use .net core 6 to create an online chat application backend. I plan on using postgresql, react and websockets.

## GOAL
1. To learn how to use .net core by tackling this project and figuring out things by myself.
2. Learn how to make controllers, models, data transfer objects, and connect to a database.
3. Deploy the app on heroku.
